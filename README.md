# OT Security Notes

Working notes, fragments, and developing thinking on OT security in industrial environments.

This is not a finished body of work. It is where ideas are developed before they are ready to stand on their own.

Content here is exploratory. Arguments may be incomplete. Positions may shift. Some of this will be refined and published elsewhere. Some of it will not.

## What this is

Observations from practice that have not yet resolved into a clear analytical position. Structural patterns that are recognizable but not yet fully articulated. Questions that are worth sitting with before answering.

If you are looking for finished analytical writing, that lives in [operational-resilience-security](https://github.com/mattiaspilroth/operational-resilience-security).

## What is here

Notes and fragments are loosely grouped but not formally structured. Groupings will shift as thinking develops.

Topics currently in progress include operational constraints in long-lifecycle environments, consequence-driven approaches to control selection, and the organizational dynamics that shape how security programs evolve in distributed industrial settings.

## Engagement

If something here connects with something you have observed in practice, that is worth a conversation.

Incomplete ideas benefit from contact with operational experience more than finished ones do.
